        Defaults to 100.

        :param timeout: Timeout in seconds for long polling. Defaults to 0, i.e. usual short polling. \

        of the IP address resolved through DNS.

        :param max_connections: The maximum allowed number of simultaneous HTTPS connections to the webhook \

        load on your bot's server, and higher values to increase your bot's throughput. \
